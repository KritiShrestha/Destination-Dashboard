# Traveler Dashboard

>## Description 
For this project, we built an application using JavaScript and Bulma that displays city information along with forecast data. We used the Open-Meteo API to display the current weather data for a city along with a 5-day forecast. We used the Teleport API to pull the city population, city rankings, and city images. There is also an image modal that displays a map for each city. In addition, the selected city is saved in local storage so that the information displays after the page reloads.

>## Deployment/Installation

There is no installation required for this website. The webpage can be found by clicking the link below:
